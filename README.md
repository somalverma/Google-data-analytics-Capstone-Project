**Case Study : How does a Bike-Share navigate speedy success?**
#### _Note:-This Case study is a part of *Google Data Analytics Specialization* certification course._ 
## Business Task
The analysts of a fictional company **Cyclistic**  have calculated that the annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. So, maximizing the number of annual membership will be the key to success for the business. It will be good to convert casual riders into members rather than targeting all new customers. So, the goal is to understand how casual riders and annual members use cyclistic bikes differently so that a strategy can be developed to convert casual riders into annual members.
## Description of Data set used
12 month cyclistic trip data has been used. It includes data from January 2021 to December 2021.
Data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. 
## Key findings
- Annual members(55.4%) made more trips than casuals(44.6%).
- Number of users in summer season is more and less in winters which means the demand for bike increases during summer period and decreases in winters.
- Classic bikers are more in numbers, there are significant number of electric bikers however very few docked bikers. Members prefer classic and electric bikes however some casual users use docked bike as well.
- Friday is most popular among casual riders whereas more annual members rides on tuesday.
## Recommendations
- Increase marketing campaigns during summer season.
- Offer an annual membership to weekday riders to increase number of annual members.
- Since the casual riders prefer to take longer trips averaging 32 minutes compared to annual members who average only 13 minutes. Members only rewards program can be introduced based on the trip duration to incentivize casual riders to sign up as members and be eligible for rewards.
