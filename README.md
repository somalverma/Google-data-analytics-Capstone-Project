Case Study : How does a Bike-Share navigate speedy success? 
## Business Task
The analysts of a fictional company **Cyclistic**  have calculated that the annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. So, maximizing the number of annual membership will be the key to success for the business. It will be good to convert casual riders into members rather than targeting all new customers. So, the goal is to understand how casual riders and annual members use cyclistic bikes differently so that a strategy can be developed to convert casual riders into annual members.
